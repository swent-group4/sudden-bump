# SuddenBump
# Description:
Staying connected with friends who are far away or making new connections can be a real challenge for students and expats. Often, friends or even friends of friends might be nearby, but with busy schedules, we don’t always notice. That’s where our app steps in—it makes meeting up with friends and new people much easier.
With our app, you can add your friends, and whenever they’re within a chosen radius, both of you will get notified, helping you plan impromptu hangouts or catch-ups. The app also offers built-in chat and meeting scheduling features. You can agree on a meeting location, see it on the map along with the friends who have confirmed, and easily coordinate getting to a common place.
We’ve designed the app to make connecting and staying in touch effortless, even with busy lives.
# Features:
- Users can log in with Google for secure authentication.
- One can search for other users and send them friend requests.
- Real-time location sharing ensures that users get notified when their friends are nearby and can see peers friends on the map.
- Users can chat with their friends and send meeting requests from their chat screen. Accepted meetings can be seen on the calendar.
- Friends using the app can see their meeting location and be re-directed to Google Maps for the exact route to the meeting point.
# Sensor use:
- GPS is used to transmit live location so one's friends can get notified when they are around.
# Offline mode:
- Previous chats are available in offline mode.
- Already scheduled meetings can also be spotted on the calendar while offline.
- Additionally one can still see their friends on Overview, but without their location.
- Settings can also be accessed and the user can change their preferences.
